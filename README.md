You need to download all the folder repository and open with the unity version 2017.3.1f1. 

After opening it with the correct unity version, you just need to open the MainScene in the scene folder, press play and follow the indications to see how the game works.

- In the scenes, you store all the personalized scenes that you want to store in your project. 

- Inside the scripts folder you will see all the code in CSharp language. There we divided all the logic of the game in the GameController, the cubes of the game with the specified shape, the player who is the element that you change the shape contiously to bypass the obstacles, and the UIManager who has the functions to change the text in the canvas.
